            <code>Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ'S)</code>
            <p>What is Roku Express 4K+?</p>
            <p>Roku Express 4K+ is a streaming player that lets you enjoy channels like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and YouTube, right on your TV and in stunning picture quality. Every Roku player, including Roku Express 4K+, lets you access a massive selection

                remote with TV controls.</p>
            <p>What is 4K streaming?</p>
            <p>4K describes the picture quality you can get while you’re streaming, as long as you have a 4K compatible TV. With 4x the pixels as standard HD picture quality, 4K is crisp and clear so you’ll experience lifelike detail. Plus with High Dynamic
                Range (HDR), you’ll experience brighter colors that pop and sharp contrast.</p>
            <p>Can you use a 4K streaming device on a non-4K TV?</p>
            <p>You can use a 4K streaming device, like Roku Express 4K+, on a non-4K TV as long as it has an HDMI port, but you’ll only be able to stream in HD picture quality. Even if you don’t have a 4K TV, you can still enjoy smooth streaming with Roku
                Express 4K+ thanks to its dual-band Wi-Fi® connection, plus a voice remote that features TV controls.</p>
